This is the changelog for the Nextstrain seasonal-flu workflow.
All notable changes in a release will be documented in this file.

This changelog is intended for _humans_ and follows many of the principles from [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Changes for this project _do not_ currently follow the [Semantic Versioning rules](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Instead, changes appear below grouped by the date they were added to the workflow.
The "__NEXT__" heading below describes changes in the unreleased development source code and as such may not be routinely kept up to date.
